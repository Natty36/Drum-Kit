# Drum 🥁 Kit

An interactive drum kit website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The interactive website allows users to play different drum sounds by clicking on on-screen buttons or pressing the corresponding keys on the keyboard.

I created this project was while learning JavaScript and DOM manipulation as part of a full-stack web development course.
